1. Determine VPP Functionality: Identify the primary commands and functionalities you need to expose via the API, such as:
// VPP is a data plane
    Getting VPP version
    Managing interfaces
    Adding/removing static routes
    Retrieving BGP neighbors (if VPP supports BGP)--->BGP is part of the control plane
    Managing OSPF (if VPP supports OSPF)

2. Create Client Classes for VPP: Implement classes to interact with VPP, similar to the FRR client classes.

3. Design Flask Endpoints: Define Flask endpoints that map to the VPP functionalities.


Pre requisites:

1. Understand VPP Command Structure
Firstly, familiarize yourself with the VPP command-line interface (CLI) and the API it exposes. This will help you understand:

How commands are structured (e.g., show, set, add, delete).
Command syntax and options (e.g., show interface, set interface state).

2. Define the API Endpoints
Identify the specific functionalities and commands you want to expose through your API. These might include:

Interface configuration (e.g., create, delete, show).
Routing configuration (e.g., add routes, show routes).
Statistics retrieval (e.g., interface statistics, packet counts).
3. Design Classes for API Implementation
Similar to the FRR example, design Python classes that encapsulate the logic for interacting with VPP:

VPPClientInterface: Handles operations related to VPP interfaces.
VPPClientRouting: Manages routing operations such as adding routes and showing routing tables.
VPPClientStatistics: Retrieves statistics from VPP, like interface stats and packet counts.
4. Implementing the VPPClient Classes
For each class:

Initialize and configure logging, similar to how it was done in the FRR example.
Implement methods that construct VPP CLI commands or interact with the VPP API to perform desired operations.
Ensure error handling and logging are in place to capture any issues during command execution.
Return results or errors from VPP operations to the calling API endpoints.

5. Implementing API Endpoints
Integrate these client classes into your backend API framework (e.g., Flask, Django):

Create routes and handlers for each endpoint that correspond to the methods in your VPPClient classes.
Handle request parameters and data formatting as required by the VPP CLI or API.
Return responses in a suitable format (e.g., JSON) to the client.
